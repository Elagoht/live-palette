# Live Palette!

I have developed a website called Live Palette that allows designers to visualize and modify their color palettes for web design. Sometimes designers may not be satisfied with the color palette they initially chose or created because it doesn't harmonize well with their website design.

With Live Palette, designers can apply their color palette to a template website and instantly see how it looks in real-time. This live preview feature enables them to make immediate color changes and observe the results.

Additionally, designers have the option to download the color palette as a card image for reference or further use.

Take a look at some examples:
